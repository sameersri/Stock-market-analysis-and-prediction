The stock market is a dynamic and complex environment where prices fluctuate rapidly based on various factors such as economic indicators, company performance, geopolitical events, and investor sentiment. Predicting stock price movements is a challenging task, but it has significant implications for investors, traders, and financial institutions. Deep learning techniques have gained prominence in financial forecasting due to their ability to capture intricate patterns in time-series data. One such powerful model is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. In this project, we explore how LSTM can be leveraged for stock market data analysis and prediction.
